You can easily self-host boreal.chat using Docker Compose.

## Installing Docker

Please follow the [official Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install Docker on your system if you haven't already.

## Running boreal.chat

To run `boreal.chat`, you need to download our `docker-compose.yaml` file and configure the `.env` file.

Let's start by downloading the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

<Tabs syncKey="platform">
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    ```bash
    wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wosherco/boreal.chat/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.deploy.yaml" -O docker-compose.yaml
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wosherco/boreal.chat/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.deploy.yaml" -OutFile "docker-compose.yaml"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now, let's download the `.env` file:

<Tabs syncKey="platform">
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    ```bash
    wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wosherco/boreal.chat/refs/heads/main/.env.deploy" -O .env
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wosherco/boreal.chat/refs/heads/main/.env.deploy" -OutFile ".env"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The values are already filled with the correct defaults, but you can modify them if needed.

Now, let's start the containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You should see boreal.chat running on port `3000` in your browser at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

<Aside type="caution">
It is **NOT** recommended to access your instance of boreal.chat using HTTP/1.1. It will be **SLOW** to the point of being unusable. Please follow the next steps to configure your instance to use HTTP/2.
</Aside>

## Configuring boreal.chat for HTTP/2

For optimal performance, you need to configure a reverse proxy to use HTTP/2.

### For Local Use (Quick Setup)

Install `caddy` on your system, run `caddy trust`, and then proxy port `3000`. Make sure to update the `PUBLIC_URL` in the `.env` file to match your setup.

### Using Caddy as a Reverse Proxy (Recommended)

You will need:
- A domain name
- An SSL certificate for that domain (you can use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) for free)

Detailed instructions for this setup will be added soon.

### Using Cloudflare Tunnel (Recommended)
