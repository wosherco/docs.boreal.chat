You can easily self-host boreal.chat by using docker-compose.

## Installing docker

Please, follow the [official docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) to install docker in your system if you haven't already.

## Running boreal.chat

To run `boreal.chat` you need to grab our `docker-compose.yaml` file, download and configure the `.env` file.

Let's start by downloading the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

<Tabs syncKey="platform">
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    ```bash
    wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wosherco/boreal.chat/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.deploy.yaml" -O docker-compose.yaml
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wosherco/boreal.chat/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.deploy.yaml" -OutFile "docker-compose.yaml"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Now, let's download the `.env` file:

<Tabs syncKey="platform">
  <TabItem label="Linux">
    ```bash
    wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wosherco/boreal.chat/refs/heads/main/.env.deploy" -O .env
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Windows">
    ```powershell
    Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wosherco/boreal.chat/refs/heads/main/.env.deploy" -OutFile ".env"
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The values are already filled with the correct values, but you can change them if you want.

Now, let's run the containers:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

You should see boreal.chat running at port `3000` in your browser, at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

<Aside type="caution">It is **NOT** recommended to access your instance of boreal.chat using http 1.1. It will be **SLOW**, to the point of being unusable. Please, follow the next steps to configure your instance to use http 2.+</Aside>

## Configuring boreal.chat to use HTTP 2.0

For running boreal.chat with http 2.0, you need to configure a reverse proxy to use http 2.0.

### For local use (quick, but not recommended)

Install `caddy` in your system, run `caddy trust`, and then proxy port `3000`. Make sure to switch the `PUBLIC_URL` in the `.env` file.

### Using caddy as a reverse proxy (recommended)

You will need:

- A domain name
- A SSL certificate for that domain name (you can use [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) to get one for free)
