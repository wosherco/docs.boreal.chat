## Troubleshooting

### Syncing/Hydration Issues

If you're experiencing issues with syncing/hydration, please try the following:

1. Open the browser's developer tools
2. Navigate to the "Application" tab and find the IndexedDB section
3. Find the database called `/pg/borealchat` and delete it
4. Refresh the page

If the issue persists, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/wosherco/boreal.chat/issues).

### Mobile UI Issues

We iterate fast, and we're working on a better mobile experience. We might miss some edge cases or focus first on the desktop experience.

If you think something can be improved, please open a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/wosherco/boreal.chat/issues).
