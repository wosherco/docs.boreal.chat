Pricing will change in the future.

## Current Plans

### Free Plan

Currently, there is a **free plan** that has basic chatting features. You can use it by bringing your own key with OpenRouter.

### Unlimited Plan

The only paid plan is **unlimited**, which offers:

- Unlimited chats with fair rate limits
- Will include in the future: files, advanced search, data analysis, and more

boreal.chat is new, and we're constantly experimenting. That's why we still don't have fixed rate limits, or if this will be the final pricing model.

## Feedback

Feel free to discuss pricing in the [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/wosherco/boreal.chat/discussions).

## Self-Hosting Option

If you're self-hosting, you will just pay for what you enable and use. Your main charges will be OpenRouter's usage. You can optionally enable voice mode and other features.
